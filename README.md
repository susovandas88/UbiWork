I have Created a Async API.
Created local "SQL DB EXPRESS" and used Code First approach in Entity Framework6(ORM).

There is two API in one is Get and another one is post.
1. GET: Host:port/api/Score
2. POST: Host:port/api/Score
   FormBody:
   [{
	"ScoreId":123,
	"Score":12.00
	
},
{
	"ScoreId":124,
	"Score":14.20
	
}]
